                    <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design
                        philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its
                        language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical
                        code for small and large-scale projects.[27</p>
                    <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.
                        Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
                        library.[28]</p>
                    <p>Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a
                        successor to the ABC programming language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new
                        features, such as list comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting,
                        and was discontinued with version 2.7 in 2020.[29] Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major
                        revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does
                        not run unmodified on Python 3. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[30] and later are
                        supported, with older versions still supporting e.g. Windows 7 (and old installers not
                        restricted to 64-bit Windows).</p>
                    <p>Python interpreters are supported for mainstream operating systems and available for a few more
                        (and in the past supported many more). A global community of programmers develops and maintains
                        CPython, a free and open-source[31] reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the
                        Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development. It
                        currently ties with Java as the second most popular programming language in the world.[32][33]

            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

            <header>HTML</header>
            <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
                in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
                multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
                cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
            <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
                <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and
                    provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
                    display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
                <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                    behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
                    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                    standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]</p>

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
                the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
            <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>

            <p>Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ JANG-goh; sometimes stylized as django)[8] is a Python-based free and open-source web
                framework that follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern.[9][10] It is maintained by
                the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an American independent organization established as a 501(c)(3)
                non-profit.</p>
            <p>Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework
                emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and
                the principle of don't repeat yourself.[11] Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and
                data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface
                that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p>
            <p>Some well known sites that use Django include PBS,[12] Instagram,[13] Mozilla,[14] The Washington
                Times,[15] Disqus,[16] Bitbucket,[17] and Nextdoor.[18]</p>

            <p>SQL (/ˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ (About this soundlisten) S-Q-L,[4] /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel"; Structured Query
                Language)[5][6][7] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held
                in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
                management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data
                incorporating relations among entities and variables.</p>
            <p>SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced
                the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to
                specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.</p>
            <p>Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of
                statements,[8] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language
                (DQL),[a] a data definition language (DDL),[b] a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation
                language (DML).[c][9] The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and
                delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is
                essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.</p>
            <p>SQL was one of the first commercial languages to utilize Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. The model was
                described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[10]
                Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely
                used database language.[11][12]</p>
            <p>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the
                International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.[13] Since then the standard has been
                revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code requires
                at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.</p>
